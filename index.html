        <p class="lead mb-4">I’m not exactly the type of student who would voluntarily conduct their own chemistry labs, but I’ve always loved watching ASAPScience videos on YouTube and ever since I came across their video about lucid dreaming, I couldn’t stop myself from exploring how the brain behaves. My junior year, I had the opportunity to act upon my interest. Through taking AP Psychology, I ultimately acquired a whole new perspective on the fascinating behaviors and mental processes of the people around me as well as myself and I loved it. After taking this class, I was inspired to complete an internship at a local counseling center where I can learn more about psychology and its application in the real world.
<br><br>

        The summer before my senior year, I experienced what it was like to be treated as both a student and an employee. In this workplace environment, I worked in the front office, applying my repertoire of technology skills that I acquired through my high school courses. I checked clients in on computers, learned how to use multiple printers, and recorded meetings and it was fairly simple. However, my deep-seated fear of that summer was picking up the phone. It was such an effortless task to complete yet I was so anxious that I would say the wrong thing to people who really needed the help. This was when I began to connect with the people there. They guided me through talking to the clients and surprisingly enough, I was able to pick up the phone two-thirds of the way through summer—better late than never, right? The college interns and counselors at this center showed me what it was like to truly help people in need and instill the value of self-care. I could tell that everyone at my internship loved what they did and shared a common goal of empowering society and each other. The dedication they had for psychology and assisting others was inspiring and I long to match their ambition and compassion through pursuing an education and eventually a career in this field as I continue to learn and grow.
<br><br>

        This is where I left off as a high school senior and now that I am a psychology major at the University of California in Riverside, I am pursuing greater education with the same interests I had many years ago. I am still as passionate as I was watching that ASAPScience YouTube video and I am learning something new everyday that is strengthening my relationship with psychology. As I look back on my academic career, I was grateful for the opportunities that I have been given at an early age, being able to have a counseling internship down before my first year of college and taking AP Psychology and passing the exam with an exceptional score. I did not know it at the time, but it helped me get ahead and gain experiences I would not have been able to obtain as easily in college now. Because of what I accomplished in high school, I am able to solidify my career in psychology and move forward without doubts.
